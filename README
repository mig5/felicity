Dodgy little python thing that:

 * Deploys a new server at Rackspace Cloud (by way of libcloud)

 * Installs a bunch of stuff like duplicity, python-boto, some scripts

 * Sets up a firewall, configures ssh to reject password auth

 * Runs a restore of backups from the Amazon S3 cloud based buckets found that match arg(1) (server name)

 * Runs a collection-status on the backups too

 * emails the results

 * Halts after 48 hours

Tonnes of ugly hacks at this stage, working on things from the TODO.

Dependencies:

 * libcloud, python, python-paramiko

Usage:

 * Read the config/felicity.ini and update to suit.
 * python felicity $servername
