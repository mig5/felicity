Things to do

 * Improve reading in of configs, no having to hardcode the connections/drivers

 * Allow for backups to come from somewhere other than Amazon S3 too. Maybe somehow inherit from the driver in use for deploying image?

 * Improve the efficiency of scripts, not sure if we really need to use `at` but it seemed to solve the issue of duplicity simply not running?

 * Improve the deployment commands (MultiStepDeployment doesn't seem to like taking an array inside an array)

 * There is no error checking right now

 * Comment the code

 * Ability to choose only certain buckets and not just all for that server

 * Perhaps pythonise the whole thing, no shell scripts

 * allow SSH in from only the machine issuing the command?

 * make things more configurable in .ini

 * perhaps don't deploy on RackSpace cloud. Seems every now and then RS has a bug where networking doesn't work until reboot of the guest

 * make a Drupal module that executes this and takes Provider/User/API key from a form (security issues?)

 * work out a way to **actually** self destruct and not just halt

 * some sort of webdav or something so people don't have to ssh in unless they want to? hook in ldap auth for this? (support system)
